				<p>My Projects are in the areas of Computer Science,Computer Vision,Machine Learning and Data
					Science.Below are my projects explained in brief followed by links to Github and Gitlab
					Repositories.</p>
				<p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>
							NoDUES-Website-for-COEP-Technological-University:
						</strong>
						Independently developed a comprehensive web application to streamline the No Dues process at
						College of
						Engineering Pune (COEP Technological University) along with almost all the colleges in the
						state. The application
						utilizes Django for the backend, Sqlite3 for database management and HTML, CSS and JavaScript
						for the frontend.
						The app enables both the students and the faculty to automate the process of NoDues which
						currently is a long
						manual procedure.Link to the Repo: <a

							target="_blank">Link</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							Binary Calculator using Simulated Pointers and Leveraging OOPS Concepts:
						</strong>
						Developed a Calculator in Python to efficiently handle multiple operations involving large
						binary numbers.
						The Project involves creation of all the data structures like Linked List, Stack, Queue and Hash
						Table from scratch
						without using any inbuilt Library modules classes. The Data Structures were built by using
						Object Oriented
						Programming Concepts. Since Python does not natively house the pointer datatype, a simulation
						was created using
						OOPs to build these Data Structures.Link to the Repo:<a
							href="https://github.com/Ninad050502/Binary-Calculator-in-Python-using-Simulated-Pointers-leveraging-OOPS-Concepts"
							target="_blank">Link</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							BRT-Lane-and-Four-Way-Traffic-Management:
						</strong>
						This is a project involving utilizing Computer Vision and Machine Learning concepts to build a
						model which detects drivers not obeying rules which are not yet monitored like WrongLane
						driving,SeatBelt enforcement,Bus-Rapid-Transit Driving,etc. Link to the Repo:<a
							href="https://github.com/Ninad050502/BRT-Lane-and-Four-Way-Traffic-Management"
							target="_blank">Link</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							Kernel Threads in xv6 Operating system:
						</strong>
						This was a group project regarding development of kernel-level support for threads (lightweight
						processes)
						and designing a user-land threading library as a wrapper for creating threads. Implemented
						semaphore
						synchronization primitives to ensure safe and efficient concurrency management. Link to the
						Repo:<a href="https://gitlab.com/adityabornare1/xv6"
							target="_blank">Link</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>
							Green Canopy:A web application which calculates percent vegetation cover of a particular area and keeps historic track of the calculations:
						</strong>
						This was a group project regarding development of a web application which calculates the amount of green cover in a given area using Google Maps API.It uses OpenCV to compute the amount of vegetation cover and also provides a comparison of the cover with respect to previously computed covers for the same area,thus answering the pertinent question of the reduction of greens in the area.

						Repo:<a href="https://github.com/Ninad050502/PPL-Mini-Project"
